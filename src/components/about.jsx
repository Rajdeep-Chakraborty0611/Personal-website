                Hey guys this is Rajdeep Chakraborty. I am a third year Engineering student in the field of Computer Science 
                specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am a passionate technical enthusiast but that is not 
                the only side to me. As a person with varying interests, I do like to keep experimenting with various stuff aside my 
                technical degree only. Photography come out to be one of those interests where I have a growing interest and have
                been practicing it for over two years now. This is my webpage and here I shall update the various sides to me, my interests
                as well as my skills as I go through the opportunities in life and grow further as a person ! So do check on me from time to
                time here, and hopefully I will have something more to show you than last time !
